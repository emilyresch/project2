# Project 2: Bookshelf

As a lover of books, I want to be able to create a profile where I can easily:

1. Search the web for different books by keyword,
2. Add books to a reading wish-list,
3. And keep track of the books I have read.

## Table of Contents

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)

2. After successful sign up, the user is now greeted with the search page. On the top right of the navigation bar, click on the search form and type the name of the book or author. Afterwards, click on the search icon.

3. After clicking on the search icon, the user is greeted with search results of the desired author or book series. In each result, the reader can:

    * Buy the book by clicking on the "Buy Book" button when available,
    * Add the book to the wishlist by clicking on the star icon,
    * Mark the book as read by clicking on the bookmark icon.

4. In the navigation bar, the wishlist and marked-as-read lists are available on the top right. Simply click on the buttons to access the lists.
